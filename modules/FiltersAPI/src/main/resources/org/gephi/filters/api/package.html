            to produce subgraphs. Filters are combined in queries that are passed
            to the system to be executed. The result of a filter query is a subgraph,
            a subset of the original graph that is represented as a
            <code>GraphView</code>.

            The role of the <code>FilterModel</code> is to
            host current queries. Each workspace has its <code>FilterModel</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The controller hosts the current <code>FilterModel</code>, for the
            current workspace.
