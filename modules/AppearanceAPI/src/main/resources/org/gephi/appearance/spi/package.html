            Interfaces that define the different ways the appearance of elements can
            be transformed.

            The purpose of transformers is to change the appearance of elements
            based on user parameters and column's values. There are three types
            of transformers: simple, ranking and partition. The simple transformer
            interface is defined in <code>org.gephi.appearance.spi.SimpleTransformer</code>.
            The ranking and partition transformers are both based on the specific value
            an element has in a given column. The ranking transformer work with
            numerical, sorted values (e.g. age, number of followers) and the 
            partition transformer work with categorical values (e.g. community id,
            gender). The ranking transformer is defined in <code>org.gephi.appearance.spi.RankingTransformer</code>
            and the partition transformer in <code>org.gephi.appearance.spi.PartitionTransformer</code>.
            Then, transformers can be associated with user interfaces elements
            through the implementation of <code>org.gephi.appearance.spi.TransformerUI</code>.
