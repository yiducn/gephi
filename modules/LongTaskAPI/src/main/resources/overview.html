            LongTask API provides utility features for long and asynchronous task
            execution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API can be used by any module to provide a safe way to execute a
            task in a background thread with native progress and cancellation
            support, as well as error management.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>LongTask</code> interface must be implemented by classes
            which wants to add these features.
